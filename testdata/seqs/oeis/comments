A000001: I conjecture that a(i) * a(j) <= a(i*j) for all nonnegative integers i and j. - _Jorge R. F. F. Lopes_, Apr 21 2024
A000001: In (J. H. Conway, Heiko Dietrich and E. A. O'Brien, 2008), a(n) is called the "group number of n", denoted by gnu(n), and the first occurrence of k is called the "minimal order attaining k", denoted by moa(k) (see A046057). - _Daniel Forgues_, Feb 15 2017
A000001: It is conjectured in (J. H. Conway, Heiko Dietrich and E. A. O'Brien, 2008) that the sequence n -> a(n) -> a(a(n)) = a^2(n) -> a(a(a(n))) = a^3(n) -> ... -> consists ultimately of 1s, where a(n), denoted by gnu(n), is called the "group number of n". - _Muniru A Asiru_, Nov 19 2017
A000001: MacHale (2020) shows that there are infinitely many values of n for which there are more groups than rings of that order (cf. A027623). He gives n = 36355 as an example. It would be nice to have enough values of n to create an OEIS entry for them. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 02 2021
A000002: (a(n)) is the unique fixed point of the 2-block substitution beta
A000002: 11 -> 12
A000002: 12 -> 122
A000002: 21 -> 112
A000002: 22 -> 1122.
A000002: A 2-block substitution beta maps a word w(1)...w(2n) to the word
A000002: A weaker problem is to construct a combinatorial bijection between the set of positions of 1's and the set of positions of 2's. - _Gus Wiseman_, Mar 01 2016
A000002: Conjecture: Taking the sequence in word lengths of 10, for example, batch 1-10, 11-20, etc., then there can only be 4, 5 or 6 1's in each batch. - _Jon Perry_, Sep 26 2012
A000002: From _Jean-Christophe Hervé_, Oct 04 2014: (Start)
A000002: From _Michel Dekking_, Jan 31 2018: (Start)
A000002: Historical note: the sequence might be better called the Oldenburger-Kolakoski sequence, since it was discussed by Rufus Oldenburger in 1939; see links. - _Clark Kimberling_, Dec 06 2012.  However, to avoid confusion, this sequence will be known in the OEIS as the Kolakoski sequence. It is undesirable to have some entries refer to the Oldenburger-Kolakoski sequence and others to the Kolakoski sequence. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 22 2017
A000002: If the word has odd length, then the last letter is ignored.
A000002: If we map 1 to +1 and 2 to -1, then the mapped sequence would have a [conjectured] mean of 0, since the Kolakoski sequence is [conjectured] to have an equal density (1/2) of 1s and 2s. For the partial sums of this mapped sequence, see A088568. - _Daniel Forgues_, Jul 08 2015
A000002: It is an unsolved problem to show that the density of 1's is equal to 1/2.
A000002: It was noted by me in 1979 in the Bordeaux seminar on number theory that (a(n+1)) is fixed point of the 2-block substitution 11 -> 21, 12 -> 211, 21 -> 221,  22 -> 2211. (End)
A000002: Kupin and Rowland write: We use a method of Goulden and Jackson to bound freq_1(K), the limiting frequency of 1 in the Kolakoski word K. We prove that |freq_1(K) - 1/2| <= 17/762, assuming the limit exists and establish the semirigorous bound |freq_1(K) - 1/2| <= 1/46. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Sep 16 2008
A000002: Looking at the plot for A088568, it seems that although the asymptotic densities of 1s and 2s appear to be 1/2, there might be a bias in favor of the 2s. I.e., D(1) = 1/2 - O(log(n)/n), D(2) = 1/2 + O(log(n)/n). - _Daniel Forgues_, Jul 11 2015
A000002: Named after the American artist and recreational mathematician William George Kolakoski (1944-1997). - _Amiram Eldar_, Jun 17 2021
A000002: The sequence does not contain words of the form ababa, because this would imply the impossible 111 (1 b, 1 a, 1 b) somewhere before. This demonstrates the conjecture made by _Jon Perry_: more than 6 1's or 6 2's in a word of 10 would necessitate something like aabaabaaba, which would imply the impossible 12121 before (word aabaababaa is also impossible because of ababa). The remark on the sextuplets below even shows that the number of 1's in any 9-tuplet is always 4 or 5.
A000002: The sequence is cubefree and all square subwords have lengths which are one of 2, 4, 6, 18 and 54 (see A294447) [Carpi, 1994].
A000002: There are only 6 triples that appear in the sequence (112, 121, 122, 211, 212 and 221); and by the preceding argument, only 18 sextuplets: the 6 double triples (112112, etc.); 112122, 112212, 121122, 121221, 211212, and 211221; and those obtained by reversing the order of the triples (122112, etc.). Regarding the density of 1's in the sequence, these 12 sextuplets all have a density 1/2 of 1's, and the 6 double triples all lead to a word with this exact density after transformation by the Kolakoski rules, for example: 112112 -> 12112122 (4 1's/8); this is because the second triple reverses the numbers of 1's and 2's generated by the first triple. Therefore, the sequence can be split into the double triples on one side, a part whose transformation (which is in the sequence) has a density of 1's of 1/2; and a part with the other sextuplets, which has directly the same density of 1's. (End)
A000002: This is a fractal sequence: replace each run with its length and recover the original sequence. - _Kerry Mitchell_, Dec 08 2005
A000002: beta(w(1)w(2))...beta(w(2n-1)w(2n)).
A000002: freq_1(K) is conjectured to be 1/2 + O(log(K)) (see PlanetMath link). - _Jon Perry_, Oct 29 2014
A000003: Also, when setting K3(x)=hypergeom([1/3,2/3],[1], x^3) and solving for x such that K3((1-x^3)^(1/3))/K3(x)==sqrt(n), then the degree of the minimal polynomial of x^3 is every third term of this sequence, or so it seems. (End)
A000003: From _Joerg Arndt_, Sep 02 2008: (Start)
A000003: It seems that 2*a(n) gives the degree of the minimal polynomial of (k_n)^2 where k_n is the n-th singular value, i.e., K(sqrt(1-k_n^2))/K(k_n)==sqrt(n) (and K is the elliptic integral of the first kind: K(x) := hypergeom([1/2,1/2],[1], x^2)).
A000003: a(n) appears to be the degree of Klein's j-invariant j(sqrt(-n)) as an algebraic integer. - _Li Han_, Mar 02 2020
A000005: (End)
A000005: Also equal to the number of partitions p of n such that all the parts have the same cardinality, i.e., max(p)=min(p). - _Giovanni Resta_, Feb 06 2006
A000005: Equals A127093 as an infinite lower triangular matrix * the harmonic series, [1/1, 1/2, 1/3, ...]. - _Gary W. Adamson_, May 10 2007
A000005: Equals row sums of triangle A143319. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Aug 07 2008
A000005: Equals row sums of triangle A159934, equivalent to generating a(n) by convolving A000005 prefaced with a 1; (1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, ...) with the INVERTi transform of A000005, (A159933): (1, 1,-1, 0, -1, 2, ...). Example: a(6) = 4 = (1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2) dot (2, -1, 0, -1, 1, 1) = (2, -1, 0, -2, 3, 2) = 4. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Apr 26 2009
A000005: For odd n, this is the number of partitions of n into consecutive integers. Proof: For n = 1, clearly true. For n = 2k + 1, k >= 1, map each (necessarily odd) divisor to such a partition as follows: For 1 and n, map k + (k+1) and n, respectively. For any remaining divisor d <= sqrt(n), map (n/d - (d-1)/2) + ... + (n/d - 1) + (n/d) + (n/d + 1) + ... + (n/d + (d-1)/2) {i.e., n/d plus (d-1)/2 pairs each summing to 2n/d}. For any remaining divisor d > sqrt(n), map ((d-1)/2 - (n/d - 1)) + ... + ((d-1)/2 - 1) + (d-1)/2 + (d+1)/2 + ((d+1)/2 + 1) + ... + ((d+1)/2 + (n/d - 1)) {i.e., n/d pairs each summing to d}. As all such partitions must be of one of the above forms, the 1-to-1 correspondence and proof is complete. - _Rick L. Shepherd_, Apr 20 2008
A000005: From _Tomohiro Yamada_, Oct 27 2020: (Start)
A000005: If the canonical factorization of n into prime powers is Product p^e(p) then d(n) = Product (e(p) + 1). More generally, for k > 0, sigma_k(n) = Product_p ((p^((e(p)+1)*k))-1)/(p^k-1) is the sum of the k-th powers of the divisors of n.
A000005: Let k(n) = log d(n)*log log n/(log 2 * log n), then lim sup k(n) = 1 (Hardy and Wright, Chapter 18, Theorem 317) and k(n) <= k(6983776800) = 1.537939... (the constant A280235) for every n (Nicolas and Robin, 1983).
A000005: Note that d(n) is not the number of Pythagorean triangles with radius of the inscribed circle equal to n (that is A078644). For number of primitive Pythagorean triangles having inradius n, see A068068(n).
A000005: Number of 2D grids of n congruent rectangles with two different side lengths, in a rectangle, modulo rotation (cf. A038548 for squares instead of rectangles). Also number of ways to arrange n identical objects in a rectangle (NOT modulo rotation, cf. A038548 for modulo rotation); cf. A007425 and A140773 for the 3D case. - _Manfred Boergens_, Jun 08 2021

A000005: Number of times n appears in an n X n multiplication table. - _Dominick Cancilla_, Aug 02 2010
A000005: Number of ways to write n as n = x*y, 1 <= x <= n, 1 <= y <= n. For number of unordered solutions to x*y=n, see A038548.
A000005: The only numbers k such that tau(k) >= k/2 are 1,2,3,4,6,8,12. - _Michael De Vlieger_, Dec 14 2016
A000005: There exist infinitely many n such that d(n) = d(n+1) (Heath-Brown, 1984). The number of such integers n <= x is at least c*x/(log log x)^3 (Hildebrand, 1987) but at most O(x/sqrt(log log x)) (Erdős, Carl Pomerance and Sárközy, 1987).
A000005: a(n) is also the number of partitions of 2*n into equal parts, minus the number of partitions of 2*n into consecutive parts. - _Omar E. Pol_, May 03 2017
A000006: Conjecture: No two successive terms in the sequence differ by more than 1. Proof of this would prove the converse of the theorem that every prime is surrounded by two consecutive squares, namely |sqrt(p)|^2 and (|sqrt(p)|+1)^2. - _Cino Hilliard_, Jan 22 2003
A000006: Equals the number of squares less than prime(n). Cf. A014689. - _Zak Seidov_ Nov 04 2007
A000006: The above conjecture is Legendre's conjecture that for n > 0 there is always a prime between n^2 and (n+1)^2. See A014085, number of primes between two consecutive squares, which is also the number of times n is repeated in the present sequence. - _Jean-Christophe Hervé_, Oct 25 2013
A000007: A fixed point of the run length transform. - _Chai Wah Wu_, Oct 21 2016
A000007: Another consequence of changing the offset to 1 is that then this sequence can be described as the sum of Moebius mu(d) for the divisors d of n. - _Alonso del Arte_, Nov 28 2011
A000007: Changing the offset to 1 gives the arithmetical function a(1) = 1, a(n) = 0 for n > 1, the identity function for Dirichlet multiplication (see Apostol). - _N. J. A. Sloane_
A000007: Changing the offset to 1 makes this the decimal expansion of 1. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 13 2014
A000007: Hankel transform (see A001906 for definition) of A000007 (powers of 0), A000012 (powers of 1), A000079 (powers of 2), A000244 (powers of 3), A000302 (powers of 4), A000351 (powers of 5), A000400 (powers of 6), A000420 (powers of 7), A001018 (powers of 8), A001019 (powers of 9), A011557 (powers of 10), A001020 (powers of 11), etc. - _Philippe Deléham_, Jul 07 2005
A000007: Historically there has been some disagreement as to whether 0^0 = 1. Graphing x^0 seems to support that conclusion, but graphing 0^x instead suggests that 0^0 = 0. Euler and Knuth have argued in favor of 0^0 = 1. For some calculators, 0^0 triggers an error, while in Mathematica, 0^0 is Indeterminate. - _Alonso del Arte_, Nov 15 2011
A000007: The alternating sum of the n-th row of Pascal's triangle gives the characteristic function of 0, a(n) = 0^n. - _Daniel Forgues_, May 25 2010

A000007: This is the identity sequence with respect to convolution. - _David W. Wilson_, Oct 30 2006
A000007: With the convention 0^0 = 1, 0^n = 0 for n > 0, the sequence a(n) = 0^|n-k|, which equals 1 when n = k and is 0 for n >= 0, has g.f. x^k. A000007 is the case k = 0. - _George F. Johnson_, Mar 08 2013

A000008: Number of partitions of n into parts 1, 2, 5, and 10.
A000008: There is a unique solution to this puzzle: "There are a prime number of ways that I can make change for n cents using coins of 1, 2, 5, 10 cents; but a semiprime number of ways that I can make change for n-1 cents and for n+1 cents." There is a unique solution to this related puzzle: "There are a prime number of ways that I can make change for n cents using coins of 1, 2, 5, 10 cents; but a 3-almost prime number of ways that I can make change for n-1 cents and for n+1 cents." - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Aug 26 2005
A000009: Because for these partitions the exponents of the parts 1, 2, ... are either 0 or 1 (j^0 meaning that part j is absent) one could call these partitions also 'fermionic partitions'. The parts are the levels, that is the positive integers, and the occupation number is either 0 or 1 (like Pauli's exclusion principle). The 'fermionic states' are denoted by these partitions of n. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, May 14 2014
A000009: Bijection: given n = L1* 1 + L2*3 + L3*5 + L7*7 + ..., a partition into odd parts, write each Li in binary, Li = 2^a1 + 2^a2 + 2^a3 + ... where the aj's are all different, then expand n = (2^a1 * 1 + ...)*1 + ... by removing the brackets and we get a partition into distinct parts. For the reverse operation, just keep splitting any even number into halves until no evens remain.
A000009: Conjecture: Each positive integer n can be written as a_1 + ... + a_k, where a_1,...,a_k are strict partition numbers (i.e., terms of the current sequence) with no one dividing another. This has been verified for n = 1..1350. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Apr 14 2023
A000009: Conjecture: For each integer n > 7, a(n) divides none of p(n), p(n) - 1 and p(n) + 1, where p(n) is the number of partitions of n given by A000041. This has been verified for n up to 10^5. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, May 20 2023 [Verified for n <= 2*10^6. - _Vaclav Kotesovec_, May 23 2023]
A000009: Considering all partitions of n into distinct parts: there are A140207(n) partitions of maximal size which is A003056(n), and A051162(n) is the greatest number occurring in these partitions. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Jun 13 2009
A000009: Equals A035363 convolved with A010054. The convolution square of A000009 = A022567 = A000041 convolved with A010054. A000041 = A000009 convolved with A035363. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Jun 11 2009

A000009: Ewell (1973) gives a number of recurrences. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 14 2020
A000009: Jack Grahl and Franklin T. Adams-Watters prove this claim of Jon Perry's by observing that the Ferrers dual of a "gapless" partition is guaranteed to have distinct parts; since the Ferrers dual is an involution, this establishes a bijection between the two sets of partitions. - _Allan C. Wechsler_, Sep 28 2021
A000009: Number of different partial sums 1+[1,2]+[1,3]+[1,4]+..., where [1,x] indicates a choice. E.g., a(6)=4, as we can write 1+1+1+1+1+1, 1+2+3, 1+2+1+1+1, 1+1+3+1. - _Jon Perry_, Dec 31 2003
A000009: Number of partitions of n in which the largest part occurs an odd number of times and all other parts occur an even number of times. (Such partitions are the duals of the partitions with odd parts.) - _David Wasserman_, Mar 04 2009

A000009: The number of different ways to run up a staircase with m steps, taking steps of odd sizes (or taking steps of distinct sizes), where the order is not relevant and there is no other restriction on the number or the size of each step taken is the coefficient of x^m.
A000009: The result that number of partitions of n into distinct parts = number of partitions of n into odd parts is due to Euler.
A000009: The set of partitions containing only odd parts forms a monoid under the product described in comments to A047993. - _Richard Locke Peterson_, Aug 16 2018
A000009: a(n) equals the number of permutations p of the set {1,2,...,n+1}, written in one line notation as p = p_1p_2...p_(n+1), satisfying p_(i+1) - p_i <= 1 for 1 <= i <= n, (i.e., those permutations that, when read from left to right, never increase by more than 1) whose major index maj(p) := Sum_{p_i > p_(i+1)} i  equals n. For example, of the 16 permutations on 5 letters satisfying p_(i+1) - p_i <= 1, 1 <= i <= 4, there are exactly two permutations whose major index is 4, namely, 5 3 4 1 2 and 2 3 4 5 1. Hence a(4) = 2. See the Bala link in A007318 for a proof. - _Peter Bala_, Mar 30 2022
A000009: a(n) is the sum of the number of partitions of x_j into at most j parts, where j is the index for the j-th triangular number and n-T(j)=x_j. For example; a(12)=partitions into <= 4 parts of 12-T(4)=2 + partitions into <= 3 parts of 12-T(3)=6 + partitions into <= 2 parts of 12-T(2)=9 + partitions into 1 part of 12-T(1)=11 = (2)(11) + (6)(51)(42)(411)(33)(321)(222) + (9)(81)(72)(63)(54)+(11) = 2+7+5+1 = 15. - _Jon Perry_, Jan 13 2004

A000010: For n > 1, a(n) appears to be equal to the number of semi-meander solutions for n with top arches containing exactly 2 mountain ranges and exactly 2 arches of length 1. - _Roger Ford_, Oct 11 2017
A000010: Formulas for products corresponding to the sums above may found using the substitution h(n) = log(f(n)) where f(n) > 0 (for example, cf. formulas for the sum A018804 and product A067911 of gcd(n,k)):

A000010: a(n) equals the Jordan function J_1(n) (cf. A007434, A059376, A059377, which are the Jordan functions J_2, J_3, J_4, respectively). (End)
A000010: a(n) equals the Ramanujan sum c_n(n) (last term on n-th row of triangle A054533).
A000010: a(n) is the highest degree of irreducible polynomial dividing 1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^(n-1) = (x^n - 1)/(x - 1). - _Alexander Adamchuk_, Sep 02 2006, corrected Sep 27 2006
A000010: a(n) is the minimum dimension of a lattice able to generate, via cut-and-project, the quasilattice whose diffraction pattern features n-fold rotational symmetry. The case n=15 is the first n > 1 in which the following simpler definition fails: "a(n) is the minimum dimension of a lattice with n-fold rotational symmetry". - _Felix Flicker_, Nov 08 2017
A000010: a(n) is the number of rational numbers p/q >= 0 (in lowest terms) such that p + q = n. - _Rémy Sigrist_, Jan 17 2021
